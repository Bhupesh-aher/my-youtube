<!-- Cache - 

time compelxity to search in array - O(n)
time compelxity to search in object - O(1)

in regular data structure terms we call it map, hashmap in js we called it as object

to find a key in object - O(1) 

{ 
      i: 
      ip:
      iph:
      iphone:
}


or we can use 
new map() which is class in js which is even more optimized then searching inside object

for our use we are using object

 - 2 ways we can handle live data -
        - Web Sockets 
        its a handshake between server and UI
        now you quickley send data from either side (from both the sides & whenevr you want to)
        no regular interval
        Trading apps (zerodha)
        live chat appliaction

        - Long Polling (API Polling) 
        its one directional (UI request it & data flow from server to UI)
        after interval
